# Recipe Website
Final project for the Java Web Tech-degree built with the Spring Framework

Original HTML & CSS files were supplied to me from [treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) in which I updated to support Thymeleaf. 

## Overview
A Java Web application for adding, editing and searching for recipes. The website also required authentication and a REST API along side this.
